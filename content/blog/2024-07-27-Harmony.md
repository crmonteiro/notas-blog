I've been thinking about this episode from the Reformation: the Collegiate Church on a Thursday in 1530, eviscerated. The inhabitants of Neuchâtel had stormed the church and tore down statues and images in reaction to its priests, who were depicted as liars and murderers by leaders of the movement.[^1] A few days later, a town vote would convert Neuchâtel to protestantism, and over time, into a haven for those fleeing from persecution.[^2]

The parallels with current times are like looking through a kaleidoscope: there is little variation in nature, only in content. These are today's shards: Summer waves break record highs and all elections become crucial; dialogue erodes in the West and we barter over the planets that we'll colonize. While some have taken to the trampling of statues, some have stopped voting and watching the news, and have moved to other countries in search of being left alone. The "we" is fragmented.

I find myself longing for the harmony of that mob, inflamed by a fierce, psychotic belief in the right. This is a natural reaction: the mob mentality is born out of a desperate search for a pattern to which it can respond. The trampling is its attempt to impose order in chaos. Think of Neuchâtel in those weeks: in a town of 1600 people,[^3] the protestant vote would win by the slimmest margin of 18.[^2]

Maybe we are sensing the same quaking that brought about the Reformation: the swaying and shaking, the falling, the blaring, the kaleidoscopic shift in our foundations which some call an ideological transition. We see destruction, but not yet the rescue or the statues we will build, no meaning in the forming pattern, not yet a unifying hope that snaps the narrative into place.
