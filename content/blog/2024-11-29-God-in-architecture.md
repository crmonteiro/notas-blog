I currently live across the street from an Evangelical church, whose relationship to architecture could not be more different—oppositional—from a Catholic one. Evangelicals are proud of housing churches in garages and repurposed store fronts, places without a single invitation to contemplation, a defiant "God can be met everywhere", neglecting the fact, of course, that God can also be met in architecture.
