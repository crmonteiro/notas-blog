I currently live across the street from an Evangelical church, whose relationship to architecture could not be more different to a Catholic one, to the point of oppositional. They are proud to house their churches in garages and repurposed store fronts, places without a single invitation to contemplation, a defiant "God can be met everywhere", neglecting the fact, however, that God can also be met in architecture.
