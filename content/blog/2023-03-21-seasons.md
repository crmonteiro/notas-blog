>We went into it probably thinking too much about what we were not going to be able to have, you know? ‘Oh, my goodness. No strawberries in January.’ But when we changed our thinking and started every meal with the question, ‘What do we have? What’s in season? What do we have plenty of?’ — it became really a long exercise in gratitude.[^1]

Barbara Kingsolver and her family ate only locally-sourced food for a year, which meant following the seasons and slowing down to a time when lettuce or an orange would have been something you waited for, or a luxury.

Everything is ruled by rhythms: meals and rest, joy and grief, concrete guided by light like a sunflower. We don’t know anything outside these rhythms except burnout. What’s in season? What do we have plenty of?
